   download any package format as long as the necessary unpacking tools are
   available.

2. Copy the downloaded package into the 'extension' directory of your
   eZ publish installation.

3. Unpack the files in the distribution.

   Windows users should unzip the files. The 'ezchat' directory will be created
   inside the 'extension' directory.

   Linux users may use of the following commands depending on the file type:
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf ezchat-0.1.tar.gz
   [bz2]:
   $ tar -jxvf ezchat-0.1.bz2
   [zip]:
   $ unzip ezchat-0.1.zip

4. Run the proper sql dump located in the ezchat/sql folder. For
   MySQL, run mysql.sql, etc...
   This dump may be integrated into the eZpublish database, or in an other
   database if you configure dbConnection properties in the settings/ezchat.ini
   file.

5. Configure dbConnection settings in settings/ezchat.ini file, if you have separated
   base for ezChat : uncomment dbConnection paragraph, and put right values in
   host, user, pass, name, type parameters (see eZpublish doc for similar site.ini
   parameters).

6. Add a rewrite rule (in Apache conf, if used)

   If you use recommended rewrite rules for eZ Publish
   ( http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/techn.../4_0/installation/virtual_host_setup ),
   you should add this rewrite rule as well:

   RewriteRule ^/extension/ezchat/ajaxchat/.* - [L]

6. Enable the eZchat extension in eZ publish.

   To enable eZchat for all of your siteaccesses, log in to your eZ publish
   administration interface, click on the 'Setup' tab, and then click
   'Extensions' on the left. You will see the list of available extensions.
   Select the 'ezchat' item and click the 'Apply changes' button.
   Aternatively, you can also edit the file 'site.ini.append.php' located
   in the 'settings/override' directory. Add the following line under
   the [ExtensionSettings] section:

   ActiveExtensions[]=ezchat

   Create the file and/or the section if they do not exist.

   To enable eZchat for only a single siteaccess, open the 'site.ini.append.php'
   file located in the 'settings/siteaccess/your_siteaccess' directory.
   Add the following line under the [ExtensionSettings] section:

   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezchat

   Create the file and/or the section if they do not exist.


7. Clear all the eZ publish caches.

   Log in to your eZ publish administration interface, select the 'Setup' tab,
   and then click the 'Clear all caches' button. You can also use the
   developer toolbar (if enabled) located in the right hand side.
   Simply select 'All caches' from the drop-down list and click the 'Clear' button.

   The other way to clear all caches is to remove the contents of 'var/cache/'
   and/or 'var/your_siteaccess/cache/' directory. This can either be done
   manually or by making use of a script.

   Linux users may launch the following script:

   $ ./bin/shell/clearcache.sh --clear-all

   If you have PHP CLI installed, you can also do the following (this script
   should also work on Windows):

   $ ./bin/php/ezcache.php --clear-all

8. Clear the browser caches

   Browsers usually cache visited pages in a folder somewhere. The next time
   the same pages are visited, they are loaded faster because some of the
   information already exists on the local storage device. If you already have
   eZchat installed and you're upgrading it then you will have to clear the
   browser's cache.
